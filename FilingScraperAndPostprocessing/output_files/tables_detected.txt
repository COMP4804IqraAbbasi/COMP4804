 ?Many of our existing agreements may not have been negotiated on an arm?s-length basis.?Conflicts of interest with HHMLP may result in decisions that do not reflect our best interests.?Sales or refinancing of certain hotels acquired from related parties may lead to decisions not in our best interest.

 ?a complete suspension or significant reduction of operations at many of our properties, including our largest concentration of properties in New York City, which has been disproportionately adversely affected by COVID-19;?a variety of factors related to the coronavirus have caused, and may continue to cause, a sharp decline in group, business and leisure travel, including but not limited to (i) restrictions on travel mandated by governmental entities or voluntarily imposed by employers, (ii) the postponement or cancellation of conventions and conferences, music and arts festivals, sporting events and other large public gatherings, (iii) the closure of amusement parks, museums and other tourist attractions, (iv) the closure of colleges and universities, and (v) negative public perceptions of travel and public gatherings in light of the perceived risks associated with COVID-19;?travelers have been, and may continue to be, wary to travel where, or because, they may view the risk of contagion as increased and contagion or virus-related deaths linked or alleged to be linked to travel to our properties, whether accurate or not, may injure our reputation;?travelers may be dissuaded from traveling due to possible enhanced COVID-19-related screening measures and vaccine mandates or lack of mandates which are being implemented across multiple markets we serve;?travelers may be dissuaded from traveling due to the concern that additional travel restrictions implemented between their departure and return may affect their ability to return to their homes;?commercial airline service has been reduced or previously suspended to many of the areas in which our hotels are located, if scheduled airline service does not increase or return to normal levels it could negatively affect our revenues;?there remain uncertainties as to the amount of vaccine available for distribution, particularly internationally, the public's willingness and ability to get vaccinated, and the overall efficacy of the vaccines, especially as new variant strains of COVID-19 have emerged which have a higher level of resistance to administered vaccines;   
 ?the reduced economic activity could also result in an economic recession, and increased unemployment, which could negatively impact future ability or desire to travel lodging demand and, therefore, our revenues, even when temporary restrictions are not in place;?a decrease in the ancillary revenue from amenities at our properties;?the financial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has (i) negatively impacted our compliance with covenants in certain debt obligations, triggering cash management provisions provided for in one mortgage and (ii) could negatively impact our future compliance with the financial covenants of our Credit Facility after these covenants again become applicable in 2022, which could result in an event of default and an acceleration of indebtedness under the Credit Facility, which would adversely affect our financial condition and liquidity;?a potential decline in asset values at one or more of our properties encumbered by mortgage debt, which could inhibit our ability to successfully refinance one or more such properties, result in a default under the applicable mortgage debt agreement and potentially cause the acceleration of such indebtedness;?difficulty in accessing debt and equity capital on attractive terms, or at all, and a severe disruption and instability in the global financial markets or deteriorations in credit and financing conditions may affect our access to capital;?the general decline in business activity and demand for real estate transactions adversely affecting our ability to acquire additional properties;?the potential negative impact on the health of our personnel, particularly if a significant number of them are impacted, could result in a deterioration in our ability to ensure business continuity during and after this disruption;?we may be subject to increased risks related to employee matters, including increased employment litigation and claims for severance or other benefits tied to termination or furloughs as a result of hotel closures or reduced operations prompted by the effects of the pandemic;?employee or guest assertions that our properties were not adequately cleaned or that adequate safeguards were not in place to prevent contact with employees or guests may result in liabilities; and?the reduction in our cash flows, prohibitions contained in our Credit Agreements (as defined below) and, with respect to our common dividends, the terms of our declaration of trust designating our preferred shares, have caused the indefinite suspension of dividends and could impact our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders at expected levels in the future.  
 ?downturns in lodging fundamentals are more severe or prolonged in New York City compared to the United States as a whole;  
 ?negative economic conditions are more severe or prolonged in New York City compared to other areas, due to concentration of the financial industry in New York or otherwise;
